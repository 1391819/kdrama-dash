Across Asia, Jang's popularity has steadily grown, opening new doors of chance for her. She was invited to star in the Chinese TV drama, and the actress went to the mainland to participate in the international press conference.

The media gathered in close, trying not to miss a thing! The coverage had been ""hot"" since news of the drama was released.

""Miss Mermaid"", the Korean TV drama that made Asia's audience fall in love with Jang Seo-hee. It's a production that could never be overlooked in her career.

She had worked tirelessly in the drama and her hard work was not in vain. It brought her recognition as one of Korea's most talented actresses.

After ""Miss Mermaid"", the offers continued to pour in. Jang challenged herself on television to the silver screen. She didn't have a moment to catch her breath.

In the film, ""Ghost House"", she joined Cha Seung-won and played an unusual role, once again enticing her audience.

It almost seems like she was shot to stardom overnight, but that is definitely NOT the case. Her perseverance and tenacity brought her successful results, and Jang Seo-hee is grateful for that. She shared some advice with her junior actors.

She debuted in 1989 as a fledgling actress and has retained determined aspirations to this day. Jang still clings to the passion she had during her years as a rookie, letting it help lead the way into her future.

Not only is this star big in dramas and film, she's sought after constantly by marketers, for commercials and various advertisements. Even beyond Korea! Fans adore her and we're sure her male fans are curious to hear about Jang Seo-hee's IDEAL MAN.

The support of her fans has allowed her to stand as a star and Jang makes sure to share as much time as she can with them. She was all smiles during her last autograph signing event, making eye contact with each individual.

Jang will be greeting fans in the New Year with a new movie! As well as starting her journey with a pan-Asian cast in an upcoming Chinese TV drama! We hope to see fantastic results and good luck to the actress Jang Seo-hee in 2006.","Seoul, South Korea",1972-01-05,,1.0,Acting,4.747,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/zxjXig4bOTxPlCvfNPrcRMA4Ixl.jpg

After Kim graduated in 1975 from Seoul National University, they went professional and changed their band's name to Sanulrim (meaning ""Mountain Echo""). The band's psychedelic rock/hard rock sound (reminiscent of the Sex Pistols) was music Koreans hadn't heard before, and Sanulrim revitalized the Korean music scene, which was currently devastated after several major musicians were arrested for marijuana possession in the 1970s.

They held a 30th-anniversary concert in 2007 and made plans to release the 14th album. But drummer Kim Chang Ik was killed in a traffic accident in Vancouver, Canada on January 29th, 2008, and Sanulrim disbanded after his death.

Having worked as a music director and film score composer in the early 1990s, Kim also began acting onscreen. He did not only starred in movies such as Blades of Blood, Antique Bakery, Shinsukki Blues, Windstruck, and My Love Ssagajy but also in roughly 30 television shows.

82093,Daniel Henney,"Daniel Henney was born in Carson City, Michigan, to a Korean adoptee mother and Philip Henney, his American father of Irish descent. Daniel Henney started modeling in the U.S. in 2001 and worked in France, Italy, Hong Kong and Taiwan while attending college. After his debut in South Korea with an advertisement for the Amore Pacific's cosmetic ""Odyssey Sunrise"", he became a spokesperson for commercials with Jun Ji-hyun for Olympus cameras and Kim Tae-hee for Daewoo Electronics's Klasse air conditioners. Despite speaking no Korean, Henney became a household name through the South Korean hit TV drama, My Lovely Sam Soon, aka My Name is Kim Sam Soon. He played the role of Dr. Henry Kim, a surgeon who is devotedly in love with Hee-jin (played by Jung Ryeo-won). Sam Soon was the most popular Korean drama in 2005; although Henney was starring as the supporting actor, his performance and look was widely noticed. Henney then starred in another drama “Spring Waltz” in 2006. He later learned the language and appeared on a few variety shows, such as Family Outing. Henney was a part of an academic scandal in which many sources stated that he had an Economics degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago, while in actuality he had no college degree. Henney starred in his first feature film in Korea, ""Seducing Mr. Perfect."" His second film, ""My Father,"" won multiple awards in South Korea and was actually the first time in that country's history that a foreigner swept all the major cinema awards in the Best New Actor category. In 2009, he portrayed Agent Zero in the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In the fall season of 2009, he played ""Dr. David Lee"" in the CBS television drama Three Rivers. In 2010, Henney returned to South Korea television for KBS2's The Fugitive: Plan B, alongside Rain and actress Lee Na-young. Henney is signed with DNA Models in New York under the celebrity-division.","Carson City, Michigan, USA",1979-11-28,,2.0,Acting,7.329,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/4cxNfiABrndn6izXAt6TsjFfYBZ.jpg

Because of her outspokenness, MBC banned Kim in 2011 (she was originally scheduled to appear as a ""progressive"" panelist on the current affairs radio show Sohn Suk-hee's Spotlight), which led to prominent figures from academic, literary and media circles to call for a boycott of the network's programs.

Following a number of small screen credits, KIM entered both the film realm and the director’s chair in 2006 with the feature Old Miss Diary.

Though not a failure, KIM would then score his first hit with the period detective action-comedy Detective K: Secret of Virtuous Widow in 2011. Featuring KIM Myung-min as a bumbling but efficient detective in the Joseon Era, alongside with his sidekick played by OH Dal-su. Released during the Lunar New Year, the film racked up over 4.7 million admissions. Following that success, KIM briefly returned to television by directing the K-drama Live in Cheongdam-Dong, which aired its 170 episodes from the end of 2011 into the middle of 2012. Teaming up again with KIM and OH, director KIM sought to strike gold once more with a sequel to his earlier hit in 2015, entitled Detective K: Secret of the Lost Island.
